        <h1>Project: Are We Headed For a Future of Food Insecurity?</h1>
        <p>The global food crisis is a pressing issue that has been exacerbated by a combination of factors including population growth and economic instability. As the world's population continues to rise, the demand for food also increases, putting a strain on already limited resources. Economic factors such as poverty and lack of access to markets can also contribute to food insecurity. The current food crisis disproportionately affects vulnerable populations across the globe and addressing this issue is crucial for achieving global food security and stability.</p>

        <h1>Data Sources</h1>
        <p>The main sources of data that produced my visualisations came from FAO, The World Bank and Statistic Times. 
            The stacked bar (Figure 6) chart contains data taken from OurWorldInData. The data from The World Bank was saved as CSV files and cleaned in Colab, some manual data cleaning took place in the excel 
            files itself as I used code such as "=RIGHT" and "IF" statements to get a clean set of data which allowed me to produce these graphs. I implemented a scraper to obtain continents from Statistic Times which was attached to most of my datasets for my graphs.
        </p>
        <p> I accessed the world bank API to obtain the Food Insecurity Level data for my map, I did this because an API automatically updates itself and I would not have to manually update it which allows visualisations like this to be easily automated
            </p>

        <h1>The Story</h1>
        <p>As Figure 1 illustrates arable land has been declining over the past 60 years. Europe currently has the largest amount of arable land, with Africa closely following behind. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the world population is projected to reach almost 10 billion by 2050, and this increase in population will place additional pressure on food systems, leading to further decline in arable land.</p>
            
        <p> The decline in arable land is reflected in the trend of rising food prices, as shown in Figure 2. This trend is particularly detrimental for low-income countries, as they cannot afford these high prices. 
        This inequality is highlighted in Figure 3 as African countries appear to be suffering the most, with a higher share of their population unable to afford a healthy diet. This is summarised by figure 4 which shows the prevalence of food insecurity, where again, Africa is the highest. </p>
            
        <p> The Global Hunger Index (GHI ) combines four indicators: undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality. Figure 5 and 6 show the extent to which global hunger is attributed to population growth.  However, it is important to note that many countries with high population growth have recently managed to decrease levels of hunger substantially.</p>

        <p> The potential impacts of reducd outputs from Ukrain and Russia will not be felt equally everywhere as seen by figure 7 and 8. Some of the most vulnerable are countries that import directly from these countries as seen by Figure 8 where Mongolia and China will be affected greatly by the sunflower oil import shortage which is bound to occur. Food prices are rising, which means that all countries that are net importers of these commodities could feel significant impacts</p>

        <p> The data presented in this project highlights the urgent need for action to address the food crisis and ensure that all people have access to a healthy and affordable diet. This can be achieved through implementing policies and programs that promote sustainable agriculture, investing in food security programs, and addressing the root causes of conflicts that lead to food insecurity. According to the FAO, achieving zero hunger by 2030 is possible, but it will require significant changes in food systems, including increasing investment in agriculture and rural development, reducing food loss and waste, and improving trade policies.</p>
                
        </p>

        <h1>Issues I Faced</h1>
        <p>One issue that was clear was that the CSV files downloaded from the World Bank were not in a format that Vega-Lite so I used python in colab to turn the data into long form data so it could be read. I had to melt several pieces of data onto eachother and the presence of a country code really helped when combining these tables in python. The code in colab is seen above.
            The slide for the map on food insecurity was very problematic to implement, the issue was that I had not provided the necessary fields in my lookup transform, and inverting my main and lookup data helped me bring all the years for my countries. Aside from that, the interactivity elements for thre other charts were fairly simple to implement. In terms of the actual data, it was difficult to obtain values for every country and so the story I have developed can be see to be held back by the lack of information available for every country.</p>
